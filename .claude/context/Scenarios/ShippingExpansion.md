# Shipping & Expansion

## Scenario 1: River Crossing

**Map Layout**:
```
[Player's Sheep] ~~~river~~~ [£4 Mountain hex]
```

**Without Shipping** (Level 0):
- Cannot place Miner on mountain
- River blocks adjacency
- Stuck on one side

**Action**: Upgrade Shipping to Level 1
- Pay £4
- Now have river-crossing

**Next Turn**: Place Miner
- Cost: £6 (Miner) + £4 (mountain) = £10
- Now adjacent via river-crossing
- Miner produces £6/round

**ROI**: £4 shipping + £10 Miner = £14 investment, £6/round return
