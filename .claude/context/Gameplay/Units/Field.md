# Field

## Overview

Fields are production units that produce Grain. Grain must be processed into Bread, Whisky, or Beer to be useful.

## Properties

**Type**: Production Unit
**Cost**: £4
**Terrain**: Grassland only
**Production**: 1 Grain per Production Phase

## Placement

### Requirements
- Grassland terrain hex
- Adjacent to owned unit OR shipping range
- Pay £4 (unit) + terrain cost

### Examples
- Field on £2 grassland = £6 total
- Field on £4 mixed grassland = £8 total

## Production

### Production Phase
- Each Field produces 1 Grain
- Automatic (no input required)
- Grain added to player's stock

### Processing Required
Grain must be processed to be valuable:
- Bakery: Grain → Bread
- Distillery: Grain → Whisky
- Brewery: Grain → Beer (Oswald only)

## Strategic Use

### Grain Chains
Fields are foundation for multiple production chains:

**Bread Chain**:
```
Field → Grain → Bakery → Bread
```

**Whisky Chain**:
```
Field → Grain → Distillery → Whisky
```

**Beer Chain** (Oswald):
```
Field → Grain → Brewery → Beer
```

### Versatility
- Grain can go to any processor
- Flexible resource allocation
- Adapt to contract needs

## Lord Synergies

### Master Godwyn (Strong)
- Starts with 2 Fields + 1 Distillery
- Whisky specialist
- Gains £3 per Whisky produced

### Brewmaster Oswald (Strong)
- Starts with 2 Fields + 1 Brewery
- Beer specialist
- Grain → Beer production

### Starting Resources
- **Lord Aldric**: Starts with 1 Field
- **Lady Marina**: Starts with 1 Field

## Comparison

| Unit | Cost | Production | Processing Options |
|------|------|------------|-------------------|
| Sheep | £5 | Wool | None (direct use) |
| Cow | £6 | Milk | 1 option (Cheese) |
| Field | £4 | Grain | 3 options (Bread/Whisky/Beer) |

**Field Advantages**:
- Cheapest production unit (£4)
- Most processing options (versatile)
- Supports multiple strategies

**Field Disadvantages**:
- Must process (cannot use Grain directly)
- Requires factory investment
- Delays value realization

## Processing Decisions

### Bakery (Bread)
- Simple processed good
- Standard contracts
- Lower value

### Distillery (Whisky)
- Higher value processed good
- Premium contracts
- Godwyn bonus (£3 per Whisky)

### Brewery (Beer) - Oswald Only
- Unique processed good
- Special contracts
- Oswald bonus

### Allocation Strategy
Multiple Fields + Multiple Processors:
- 4 Fields produce 4 Grain
- Allocate: 2 → Whisky, 1 → Bread, 1 → stock
- Flexible response to contracts

## Game States

### Unit State
- Owner
- Location (hex)
- Type: Field

### Per Production Phase
- Produce 1 Grain
- Add to owner's Grain stock

### Processing Phase
- Player allocates Grain to processors
- Bakeries/Distilleries/Breweries convert Grain

## Common Patterns

### Grain Farm (Godwyn/Oswald)
- 4-6 Fields
- 2-3 Distilleries/Breweries
- High Grain production
- Specialized processing

### Balanced Production
- 2 Fields + 2 Cows + 2 Sheep
- Diverse resources
- 1 Bakery, 1 Distillery, 1 Dairy
- Flexible contracts

### Grain Surplus Strategy
- More Fields than processors
- Grain accumulation
- Build processors as needed
- Respond to market/contracts

## Economic Calculation

**Field Investment**:
- £4 (Field) + £2 (terrain) = £6
- Produces 1 Grain per round
- Grain alone: Limited value

**With Processing**:
- £6 (Field) + £8 (Bakery + terrain) = £14 total
- Produces 1 Bread per round
- Bread contract value: High
- Multi-round payoff

**Multiple Fields**:
- 3 Fields = 3 Grain per round
- With 1 Distillery = 1 Whisky + 2 Grain stock
- Flexible allocation

## Value Decision

**When to Build Fields**:
- Have or plan processing buildings
- Need Grain products for contracts
- Godwyn or Oswald (specialists)
- Versatile production desired

**When to Skip**:
- No processor access
- Limited grassland
- Focus on simpler chains (Sheep/Wool)
- Worker income preferred
