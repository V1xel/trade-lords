# Sheep

## Overview

Sheep are basic production units that produce Wool. Simple, reliable resource generation.

## Properties

**Type**: Production Unit
**Cost**: £5
**Terrain**: Grassland only
**Production**: 1 Wool per Production Phase

## Placement

### Requirements
- Grassland terrain hex
- Adjacent to owned unit OR shipping range
- Pay £5 (unit) + terrain cost

### Examples
- Sheep on £2 grassland = £7 total
- Sheep on £5 mixed grassland/forest = £10 total

## Production

### Production Phase
- Each Sheep produces 1 Wool
- Automatic (no input required)
- Wool added to player's stock

### No Processing
- Wool used directly (no processing building)
- Simpler chain than Milk or Grain

## Strategic Use

### Early Game
- Quick resource generation
- Simple economy
- Low investment

### Contract Fulfillment
- Wool required for export contracts
- Direct use (no processing delay)

### Market Trading
- Sell Wool for gold
- Trade for other resources
- Market price varies

## Comparison

| Unit | Cost | Production | Processing |
|------|------|------------|------------|
| Sheep | £5 | Wool | None |
| Cow | £6 | Milk | Optional (Cheese) |
| Field | £4 | Grain | Required (Bread/Whisky/Beer) |

**Sheep Advantage**:
- No processing building needed
- Immediate usable resource
- Simpler logistics

**Sheep Disadvantage**:
- Wool worth less than processed goods
- Lower contract value
- No processing chain options

## Lord Synergies

### Starting Resources
- **Lord Aldric**: Starts with 1 Sheep
- **Lady Isolde**: Starts with 1 Sheep
- **Lord Caspian**: Starts with 1 Sheep
- **Lady Marina**: Starts with 1 Sheep

### Strategy Fit
- **Simple economies**: Wool + Workers
- **Early contracts**: Wool contracts early game
- **Diversified production**: Mix with Cows/Fields

## Game States

### Unit State
- Owner
- Location (hex)
- Type: Sheep

### Per Production Phase
- Produce 1 Wool
- Add to owner's Wool stock
- No other effects

## Common Patterns

### Sheep Farm
- 3-4 Sheep on adjacent grassland
- 3-4 Wool per round
- Simple resource generation

### Mixed Agriculture
- 1-2 Sheep + Cows + Fields
- Diverse resources
- Flexible contract fulfillment

## Value Calculation

**Investment**:
- £5 (Sheep) + £2 (average terrain) = £7

**Return**:
- 1 Wool per round
- Wool market value: ~£5-£7
- Break-even: ~1 round

**Contract Value**:
- Wool contracts: Standard rewards
- Less valuable than processed goods contracts
