# Brewery

## Overview

Brewery is a special processing building that converts Grain into Beer. Unique to Brewmaster Oswald.

## Properties

**Type**: Processing Building (Factory)
**Cost**: £6
**Terrain**: Grassland only
**Processing**: 1 Grain → 1 Beer per Production Phase
**Availability**: Brewmaster Oswald only (or all lords, TBD)

## Placement

### Requirements
- Grassland terrain hex
- Adjacent to owned unit OR shipping range
- Pay £6 (unit) + terrain cost
- Playing as Brewmaster Oswald (if exclusive)

## Processing

### Production Phase Processing
- Requires 1 Grain in stock
- Converts 1 Grain → 1 Beer
- Beer added to stock
- Optional (can keep Grain)

### Multiple Breweries
- Each Brewery processes 1 Grain
- 2 Breweries + 2 Grain = 2 Beer

## Strategic Use

### Beer Chain
```
Field → Grain → Brewery → Beer
```

### Oswald's Specialty
- Beer is unique resource
- Special bonuses (see Oswald.md for details)
- Potential options:
  - Production bonus (£1-£2 per Beer)
  - Enhanced market value
  - Exclusive Beer contracts
  - Combination of above

## Lord Synergies

### Brewmaster Oswald (Exclusive)
**Core Ability**: "Master Brewer"

**Possible Implementations**:
- **Option A**: Gain £2 per Beer produced
- **Option B**: Beer sells for premium market price
- **Option C**: Access to Beer-only contracts
- **Option D**: Combination

**Starting Resources**:
- 1 Brewery
- 2 Fields
- 1 Grain

### Sir Bertram
**If Oswald has Breweries**:
- Bertram discount applies to Breweries
- 1st Brewery: £3 discount
- Oswald can get cheap Breweries if playing Bertram

**Conflict**: Only one lord per game
- Either Oswald OR Bertram, not both
- Hypothetical synergy only

## Comparison

| Grain Processor | Output | Specialist | Bonus |
|-----------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Bakery | Bread | None | None |
| Distillery | Whisky | Godwyn | £3 + aging |
| Brewery | Beer | Oswald | £2 (or other) |

**Brewery Position**:
- Oswald's unique option
- Similar to Distillery (premium grain processing)
- Competes with Distillery/Bakery

## Game States

### Unit State
- Owner: Must be Brewmaster Oswald
- Location (hex)
- Type: Brewery

### Per Production Phase
- Check Grain in stock
- If Grain available: Convert 1 Grain → 1 Beer
- If no Grain: No production
- Trigger Oswald bonuses (if applicable)

## Common Patterns

### Oswald Beer Empire
- 4-6 Fields
- 3-4 Breweries
- Constant Beer production
- Production bonuses
- Beer contracts

### Mixed Oswald Production
- 3 Fields + 2 Breweries + 1 Distillery
- Some Beer, some Whisky
- Flexible allocation
- Diversified strategy

## Economic Calculation

**Brewery Investment**:
- £6 (Brewery) + £3 (terrain) = £9
- Requires Grain input
- Produces 1 Beer per round

**Full Chain (Oswald with Option A)**:
- 1 Field (£6) + 1 Brewery (£9) = £15
- Produces 1 Beer + £2 bonus = £2 per round
- Beer contract value: Special

**Comparison to Godwyn**:
- Godwyn Whisky: £3 per + aging (+£7-£15)
- Oswald Beer: £2 per (if Option A)
- Godwyn higher ceiling, Oswald simpler

## Strategy Decisions

### When to Build Breweries (Oswald)
- Core strategy (unique ability)
- Have Fields producing Grain
- Beer bonuses valuable
- Beer contracts available

### Brewery vs Distillery (Oswald)
**Brewery Advantages**:
- Oswald-specific bonuses
- Unique resource (Beer)
- Exclusive contracts (maybe)

**Distillery Advantages**:
- Higher base value (maybe)
- Available to all lords
- Well-tested mechanics

**Oswald Choice**:
- Usually prefer Brewery (his specialty)
- Can mix both for flexibility

### How Many Breweries (Oswald)
- Match to Field count (1:1)
- Or surplus Fields for flexibility
- Build multiple for volume

## Beer vs Other Processed Goods

**Beer Special Properties** (TBD):

**Option A: Production Bonus**
- Gain £2 per Beer produced
- Similar to Godwyn's £3 per Whisky
- Simpler (no aging)

**Option B: Market Premium**
- Beer sells for higher price
- Less volatile pricing
- Reliable value

**Option C: Exclusive Contracts**
- Beer contracts only for Oswald
- Premium rewards
- Unique scoring path

**Recommended**: Option D (Combination)
- Small production bonus (£1-£2)
- Occasional Beer contracts
- Slightly better market value
- Total advantage = other lords' bonuses

## Terrain Efficiency

**Field + Brewery Layout**:
```
[Field] - [Field] - [Field]
   |         |         |
[Brewery] - [Brewery]
```
Compact beer production zone

## Oswald Starting Strategy

**Turn 1 (Oswald)**:
- Have: 1 Brewery, 2 Fields, 1 Grain
- Production Phase: 2 Fields → 2 Grain total (1 + 2)
- Can convert 1 Grain → 1 Beer immediately
- Get production bonus

**Expansion Path**:
- Build more Fields (Grain production)
- Build more Breweries (Beer processing)
- Scale up Beer empire

## Processing Priority (Oswald)

**Grain Allocation**:
1. Brewery (unique bonuses)
2. Distillery (if built, premium)
3. Bakery (fallback)

**Oswald should prioritize Beer** for his ability

## Balance Considerations

**Beer Implementation**:
- Should be comparable to Godwyn's Whisky
- But different mechanics
- Simpler than aging system
- Unique flavor

**Oswald Power Level**:
- Should match other lords
- Beer bonuses balanced
- Not overpowered, not underpowered
- Different playstyle from Godwyn
