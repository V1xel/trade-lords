## Economic Calculation

**Distillery Investment**:
- £6 (Distillery) + £3 (terrain) = £9
- Requires Grain input
- Produces 1 Whisky per round

**Full Chain (Standard Lord)**:
- 1 Field (£6) + 1 Distillery (£9) = £15
- Produces 1 Whisky per round
- Whisky contract value: High

**Full Chain (Godwyn)**:
- 1 Field (£6) + 1 Distillery (£9) = £15
- Produces 1 Whisky + £3 bonus = £3 per round
- Plus aging potential: +£7 or +£15
- Extremely valuable

**Godwyn Aged Whisky Value**:
- Fresh: Base value + £3
- 1-year aged: Base value + £3 + £7 = +£10 total
- 2-year aged: Base value + £3 + £15 = +£18 total

## Strategy Decisions

### When to Build Distilleries
- Playing as Godwyn (essential)
- Have Fields producing Grain
- Want premium processed goods
- Whisky contracts available

### Distillery vs Bakery
**Distillery Advantages**:
- Higher value (Whisky > Bread)
- Godwyn bonus
- Better contracts

**Choose Bakery If**:
- Bread contracts more valuable
- Bertram discount makes Bakery cheaper
- Not Godwyn

**Generally prefer Distillery** for higher value

### How Many Distilleries (Godwyn)
- Match to Field count (1:1 ratio)
- Or more Fields for Grain surplus
- Multiple Distilleries for volume

**Example (Godwyn)**:
- 4 Fields + 3 Distilleries
- 4 Grain produced
- 3 Grain → 3 Whisky (£9 bonus)
- 1 Grain in stock
- Efficient production

## Godwyn Aging Strategy

**Aging Decision**:
- Fresh Whisky: Base value + £3
- 1-year aged: +£7 additional
- 2-year aged: +£15 additional

**When to Age**:
- Have surplus Whisky
- Playing long game
- Cellar slots available
- Don't need immediate Whisky

**When to Sell Fresh**:
- Need Whisky for contract now
- Immediate gold needed
- Cellar full

## Terrain Efficiency

**Field + Distillery Layout**:
```
[Field] - [Field] - [Field]
   |         |         |
[Distillery] - [Distillery]
```
Compact whisky production zone

## Sir Bertram Distillery Strategy

**Bertram's Advantage**:
- 1st Distillery: £3 (vs £9)
- 2nd Distillery: £2 (vs £9)
- 3rd Distillery: £2 (vs £9)
- Total for 3: £7 (vs £27)

**Bertram + Distilleries**:
- Build multiple cheap Distilleries
- Whisky production focus
- No aging bonus (not Godwyn)
- But still higher value than Bread

## Processing Priority

**If Godwyn**: Distillery #1 priority (core ability)
**If Not Godwyn**: Distillery > Bakery (higher value)
**If Oswald**: Brewery > Distillery (unique bonus)
