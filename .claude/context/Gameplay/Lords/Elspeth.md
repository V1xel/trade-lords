### Mechanics

**Milk Selling**:
- Can sell Milk for flat £8 per Milk
- Does NOT use the market
- Does NOT require merchants
- Does NOT affect market prices
- Can be done as an action

**Milk Discarding**:
- At end of Production Phase
- May discard any number of Milk from stock
- Discarded Milk is removed from game (not sold)
- Used to manage inventory limits

**Normal Milk Options Still Available**:
- Can still sell Milk on market (if price is better)
- Can still use Milk for Cheese production
- Can still use Milk for contracts
- Elspeth's ability is an additional option

### Game States Modified

**Player Actions**:
- New action: "Sell Milk to Elspeth" (£8 per Milk, no merchant needed)

**Production Phase**:
- After production, option to discard Milk

**Market**:
- Elspeth can bypass market for Milk selling

### Examples

**Example 1: Basic Milk Sale**
- Elspeth has 3 Milk
- Market price for Milk: £6
- Uses "Sell Milk to Elspeth" action
- Sells 3 Milk for £24 (3 × £8)
- Bypasses market, keeps merchants available

**Example 2: Market Comparison**
- Market Milk price: £10 (high demand)
- Elspeth's flat rate: £8
- Better to sell on market this time
- Use normal trade action instead

**Example 3: Inventory Management**
- Production Phase produces 5 Milk
- Already have 3 Milk in stock
- Total: 8 Milk (might hit inventory limit)
- Discard 2 Milk at end of Production Phase
- Keep 6 Milk for next round

**Example 4: Mixed Strategy**
- Have 4 Milk
- Sell 2 to Elspeth for £16 (guaranteed)
- Sell 2 on market for current price (merchant-based)
- Hedge against market volatility

## Strategy

### Strengths
- Guaranteed Milk income (£8 always)
- No market dependency
- Merchant-free selling (save merchants for other trades)
- Immune to Milk price crashes
- Simple, reliable economy

### Weaknesses
- Locks into dairy focus
- £8 might be below market price sometimes
- Doesn't help with other resources
- Cow-dependent strategy

### Playstyle

**Early Game**:
- Build Cows immediately
- Establish reliable Milk income
- Use guaranteed £8 for safe expansion
- Save merchants for buying goods

**Mid Game**:
- Expand cow herds
- Balance Milk sales with Cheese production
- Use steady income for contracts
- Maintain merchant advantage for other trades

**Late Game**:
- Large cow empire
- Consistent gold generation
- Convert gold to victory points
- Fulfill dairy contracts

### Key Decisions
- **Sell or Process**: Milk for £8 vs Cheese for higher value?
- **Market or Elspeth**: Compare £8 to current market price
- **Expansion**: More Cows vs Cheese Dairies?

### Economic Calculation

**Milk → Cheese Chain**:
- Milk sold to Elspeth: £8
- Milk → Cheese → Market: Variable (Cheese worth ~2x goods on contracts)
- Decision depends on contract availability and Cheese demand

**Cow Investment**:
- Cow produces 1 Milk per Production Phase
- Elspeth guarantee: £8 per Production Phase per Cow
- Safe, predictable return

### Synergies
- Benefits from grassland access (Cow placement)
- Strong with Cheese Dairy synergy (Bertram's discount)
- Complements dairy contracts

### Counters
- Limited grassland terrain
- Opponents blocking cow placement
- Contracts not requiring dairy products

## Starting Resources

- **Gold**: £10
- **Units**:
  - 2 Cows
  - 1 Cheese Dairy
- **Merchants**: 2
- **Shipping**: 0 (none)

## Difficulty

**Complexity**: Beginner
**Reason**: Simple ability, reliable income, straightforward strategy

## Victory Paths

1. **Dairy Empire**: Maximize cows, reliable Milk sales, steady gold
2. **Processing**: Cows + Dairies, focus on Cheese production
3. **Hybrid**: Balance Milk sales with Cheese production based on demand

## Price Comparison

| Market Milk Price | Best Action |
|-------------------|-------------|
| £1-£7 | Sell to Elspeth (£8) |
| £8 | Either (equal) |
| £9+ | Sell on Market |

## Income Calculation

**Per Production Phase**:
- 2 Cows = 2 Milk
- Sell to Elspeth = £16
- No merchant cost
- Guaranteed income

**Scaling**:
- 4 Cows = £32 per round (guaranteed)
- 6 Cows = £48 per round (guaranteed)
- Very reliable economic engine
