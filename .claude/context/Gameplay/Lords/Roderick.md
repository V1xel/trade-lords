# Baron Roderick the Foreman

## Identity

**Name**: Baron Roderick the Foreman
**Title**: Lord of Labor
**House Colors**: Red & Steel
**Archetype**: Worker Legion Specialist

## Appearance

Broad-shouldered knight in work-stained armor, overseer's rod, practical red surcoat with steel trim.

## Background

Rose from common mason to baron through decades of hard work and fair leadership. Commands the loyalty of all laborers in the realm.

## Ability: "Legion of Workers"

### Mechanics

**Starting Workers**:
- Starts with 3 Workers (instead of standard 1)
- Can choose worker types: Woodcutters or Miners
- Placed during setup

**Starting Shipping**:
- **3-4 Player Games**: Starts with 2-loch Shipping for free
- **1-2 Player Games**: Starts with 1-loch Shipping for free

**Value**:
- 3 Workers vs 1 standard = 2 extra workers (£12-£16 value)
- 2-loch Shipping = £8 saved (would cost £4 per level × 2)
- Total advantage: ~£20-£24 worth of starting assets

### Game States Modified

**Player State**:
- `workers_count: 3` (starting, vs standard 1)
- `shipping_level: 2` (3-4 players, vs standard 0)
- `shipping_level: 1` (1-2 players, vs standard 0)

**Setup Phase**:
- Place 3 workers instead of 1
- Shipping level pre-set

### Examples

**Example 1: Early Economy (3-4 Players)**
- Turn 1 Production Phase
- 2 Miners (£6 each) + 1 Woodcutter (£4)
- Income: £16 per round
- Plus 2-loch shipping for expansion

**Example 2: Territory Control**
- 2-loch shipping allows crossing 2 water hexes
- Can reach distant valuable territories turn 1
- Claim premium Mountain/Forest hexes early
- Block opponents from key areas

**Example 3: Worker Upgrade Path**
- Miners: £6 → £8 (when upgraded)
- 3 Upgraded Miners = £24 per Production Phase
- Massive passive income

## Strategy

### Strengths
- Strongest early game economy
- Immediate passive income (workers)
- Free shipping = wide expansion
- Can claim distant premium territories
- Worker upgrades scale income

### Weaknesses
- Doesn't help with production units
- Workers need terrain (Forest/Mountain)
- Shipping advantage diminishes as others catch up
- No factory/processing bonuses

### Playstyle

**Early Game**:
- Dominate with £16+ income per round
- Use shipping to claim best worker locations
- Establish economic dominance
- Leverage gold for rapid expansion

**Mid Game**:
- Upgrade workers (£6→£8, £4→£6)
- Continue income dominance
- Build production units with gold advantage
- Maintain territory control

**Late Game**:
- Steady passive income supports any strategy
- Convert gold to victory points
- Worker income enables expensive actions
- Flexible endgame adaptation

### Key Decisions
- **Worker Placement**: Where to place 3 starting workers?
- **Miner vs Woodcutter**: £6 income vs £4 income?
- **Shipping Usage**: Which distant territories to claim?
- **Upgrade Timing**: When to upgrade workers?

### Worker Placement Strategy

**Option 1: All Miners (3×)**
- £18 per round income
- Requires 3 Mountain hexes
- Maximum gold generation
- Terrain-dependent

**Option 2: All Woodcutters (3×)**
- £12 per round income
- Requires 3 Forest hexes
- Easier terrain requirements
- Lower income

**Option 3: Mixed (2 Miner + 1 Woodcutter)**
- £16 per round income
- Balanced approach
- Flexible terrain needs
- Recommended start

### Synergies
- Benefits from Mountain/Forest access
- Strong with worker upgrade techs
- Pairs well with any production strategy (gold enables all)
- Shipping enables Marina-like delta access

### Counters
- Limited Mountain/Forest terrain
- Opponents blocking worker locations
- Workers don't scale as well as production chains late game

## Starting Resources

- **Gold**: £8
- **Units**: 3 Workers (Woodcutters and/or Miners, player choice)
- **Merchants**: 2
- **Shipping**: 2-loch (3-4 players) or 1-loch (1-2 players)

## Difficulty

**Complexity**: Beginner
**Reason**: Straightforward ability, immediate benefits, economic safety net

## Victory Paths

1. **Economic Dominance**: Leverage early gold advantage for rapid expansion
2. **Territory Control**: Use shipping to claim best locations, block opponents
3. **Flexible Adaptation**: Strong economy enables any late-game strategy

## Income Comparison

**Round 1 Production Income**:
| Lord | Income |
|------|--------|
| Standard | £4-£6 (1 worker) |
| Roderick | £16 (2 Miners + 1 Woodcutter) |
| **Advantage** | **+£10-£12 per round** |

**By Round 3**:
- Roderick has earned £30-£36 extra gold
- Equivalent to 5-6 extra units placed
- Massive economic lead

## Upgrade Value

**Worker Upgrades**:
- Miner: £6 → £8 (+£2 per round)
