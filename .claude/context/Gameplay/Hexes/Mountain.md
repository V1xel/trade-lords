# Mountain Terrain

## Overview

Mountain terrain supports Miner workers who generate the highest passive gold income. Premium worker locations but limited availability.

## Visual

- Color: Grey/brown
- Texture: Rocky peaks, cliffs, stone
- Limited terrain type (10-15% of map)

## Placement Cost

**Pure Mountain**: £3-£4 (expensive terrain)
**Mixed with other terrain**: £4-£6

## Supported Units

### Workers Only
- **Miner** - Generates £6 income per Production Phase
- **Upgraded Miner** - Generates £8 income per Production Phase

**No other units allowed on pure mountain**

## Strategic Value

### Strengths
- Highest base worker income (£6)
- Highest upgraded income (£8)
- Passive gold generation
- Pays for itself quickly
- Upgrades very valuable

### Limitations
- Only one unit type
- Expensive terrain (£3-£4)
- Scarce (limited mountains on map)
- High competition
- No production chains

## Placement Examples

**Example 1: Pure Mountain**
- Terrain cost: £4
- Place Miner (£6): Total £10
- Income: £6 per round
- Break-even: ~2 rounds

**Example 2: Mixed Mountain/Grassland**
- Terrain cost: £5
- Can place: Miner (£6 income) OR agricultural unit
- Usually prefer Miner for high income

**Example 3: Marina Delta Discount**
- Mountain river delta: £4 terrain
- Marina discount: -£3
- Total: £6 (Miner) + £4 - £3 = £7
- Best value for premium location

## Game States

### Hex Properties
- Terrain type: Mountain
- Placement cost: £3-£4 (pure) or £4-£6 (mixed)
- Occupant: Miner only (or mixed allows others)

### Miner States
- Base: £6 income per Production Phase
- Upgraded: £8 income per Production Phase
- Highest worker income in game

## Strategic Considerations

### Premium Income
- £6 base is 50% more than Woodcutter (£4)
- £8 upgraded is 33% more than upgraded Woodcutter (£6)
- Best passive income investment

### Scarcity Competition
- Limited mountains create high demand
- Early claiming critical
- Blocking opponents from mountains strategic

### Upgrade Priority
- Miner upgrades highest ROI
- +£2 per round (£6 → £8)
- Prioritize over Woodcutter upgrades

## Lord Synergies

### Strong with Mountains
- **Baron Roderick**: Starts with 3 workers (can be Miners)
  - 3 Miners = £18 per round immediately
  - Dominates early economy

- **Lord Caspian**: Flexible workers
  - Can choose Miner role
  - All workers £4 (lower than standard Miner)

### Moderate Benefit
- All lords benefit from high passive income
- Mountain control is economic advantage

### Starting Resources
Several lords start with Miners:
- **Sir Bertram**: 1 Miner
- **Lady Marina**: 1 Miner
- Immediate income advantage

## Common Patterns

### Mountain Rush
- Prioritize claiming all accessible mountains
- Block opponents from mountain access
- Build economic dominance

### Mixed Mountain Exploitation
- Mountain/Grassland hexes
- Usually place Miner (£6 income > production value)
- Exception: Critical production needs

### Mountain Ring
- Multiple mountains around territory
- Defensive income positions
- £18-£24 per round (3-4 Miners)

## Terrain Interactions

### Mountain + Grassland
- £4-£5 cost
- Decision: Miner (£6 income) vs agricultural
- Usually Miner unless desperate for production

### Mountain + Forest
- £4-£5 cost
- Decision: Miner (£6) vs Woodcutter (£4)
- Always Miner (higher income)

### Mountain + River Delta
- Marina's specialty
- £3 discount makes premium location affordable
- £7-£8 total with discount vs £10 standard

## Placement Priority

### Highest Priority
- Low-cost mountains (£3)
- Mountain deltas (Marina)
- Mixed Mountain/Grassland (versatile)
- Early game claims

### Medium Priority
- High-cost mountains (£4)
- Isolated mountains (shipping required)

### Low Priority
- Very expensive mixed mountains (£6)
- Inaccessible mountains (far from territory)
- Late game (better investments available)

## Economy Calculation

**Single Miner**:
- Cost: £6 (unit) + £4 (terrain) = £10 total
- Income: £6 per round
- Break-even: <2 rounds
- Best worker ROI

**Upgraded Miner**:
- Upgrade cost: ~£4 (estimate)
- New income: £8 per round
- Increase: +£2 per round
- Pays for itself in 2 rounds

**Multiple Miners** (Baron Roderick start):
- 3 Miners = £18 per round (base)
- 3 Upgraded = £24 per round
- Massive economic advantage

## Comparison Table

| Worker Type | Cost | Base Income | Upgraded | Terrain Cost | Total Cost |
|-------------|------|-------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Woodcutter | £5 | £4 | £6 | £2-£3 | £7-£8 |
| Miner | £6 | £6 | £8 | £3-£4 | £9-£10 |
| Fisherman* | £6 | £4 | N/A? | £0 | £6 |

*Caspian only

## Strategic Decisions

### When to Build Miners
- **Mountains available**: Always high priority
- **Early game**: Secure before opponents
- **Income need**: Best passive income
- **Long game**: Upgrades pay off

### When to Skip
- **No mountains accessible**: Obviously
- **Very high cost**: £6+ total might not be worth it
- **Already have many**: Diminishing returns
- **Need production urgently**: Agricultural units instead

### Miner vs Production Trade-off
**Miner on £5 mixed Mountain/Grassland**:
- Total: £11
- Income: £6 per round
- Break-even: 2 rounds

**Cow on same hex**:
- Total: £11 (£6 Cow + £5 terrain)
- Production: 1 Milk per round
- Milk value: ~£6-£8 (market dependent)
- Requires processing or selling

**Usually Miner wins**: Guaranteed £6 vs variable Milk value

## Mountain Scarcity Effects

### Few Mountains on Map
- Extreme competition
- First player advantage
- Mountain control wins games
- Mixed terrain becomes critical

### Many Mountains on Map
- Lower individual value
- Worker strategies stronger
- Economic dominance easier
- More balanced competition

## Roderick Mountain Strategy

**Baron Roderick** with 3 starting Miners:
- Round 1 income: £18
- Round 2 income: £18
- Round 3 income: £18
- By Round 3: £54 extra gold vs opponents
- Can afford 5-6 extra units
- Massive early lead

**Upgrade Path**:
- Upgrade all 3 Miners to £8 each
- New income: £24 per round
- £6 increase per round
- Dominant late game economy

## Mountain Control = Economic Control

Mountains are the most valuable non-production terrain:
- Highest income per hex
- Limited availability
- High competition
- Strategic positioning
- Early control = game advantage
