# Forest Terrain

## Overview

Forest terrain supports Woodcutter workers who generate passive gold income. More limited than grassland but important for economy.

## Visual

- Color: Dark green
- Texture: Dense trees, woodland
- Moderate terrain type (15-20% of map)

## Placement Cost

**Pure Forest**: £2-£3
**Mixed with other terrain**: £3-£5

## Supported Units

### Workers Only
- **Woodcutter** - Generates £4 income per Production Phase
- **Upgraded Woodcutter** - Generates £6 income per Production Phase

**No other units allowed on pure forest**

## Strategic Value

### Strengths
- Passive income (no resource input needed)
- Woodcutters pay for themselves over time
- Simple economy (no production chains)
- Upgradeable for better income

### Limitations
- Only one unit type
- Lower income than Miners (£4 vs £6)
- No processing or production chains
- Limited strategic depth

## Placement Examples

**Example 1: Pure Forest**
- Terrain cost: £3
- Place Woodcutter (£5): Total £8
- Income: £4 per round
- Pays for itself in 2 rounds

**Example 2: Mixed Forest/Grassland**
- Terrain cost: £4
- Can place: Woodcutter OR any grassland unit
- Flexibility: Woodcutter for income OR Sheep/Cow/Field for production

**Example 3: Caspian's Flexibility**
- Caspian's Worker (£6) can be Woodcutter
- All Caspian's workers produce £4
- Same output, different cost structure

## Game States

### Hex Properties
- Terrain type: Forest
- Placement cost: £2-£3 (pure) or £3-£5 (mixed)
- Occupant: Woodcutter only (or mixed terrain allows others)

### Woodcutter States
- Base: £4 income per Production Phase
- Upgraded: £6 income per Production Phase
- Upgrade cost: Variable (game system dependent)

## Strategic Considerations

### Income Focus
- Multiple Woodcutters = steady passive income
- No resource management needed
- Simple, reliable economy

### Upgrade Priority
- Upgrading Woodcutter: £4 → £6 (+£2 per round)
- Good investment if planning long game
- Lower priority than Miner upgrades

### Forest Distribution
- Scattered forests across map
- Rarely in large clusters
- Opportunistic placement

## Lord Synergies

### Strong with Forest
- **Baron Roderick**: Starts with 3 workers (can be Woodcutters)
- **Lord Caspian**: Flexible workers (can choose Woodcutter role)

### Moderate Benefit
- All lords benefit from passive income
- Supports any strategy (gold is universal)

### Comparison
- **Woodcutter**: £4 base, £6 upgraded, easier terrain
- **Miner**: £6 base, £8 upgraded, harder terrain
- **Fisherman** (Caspian): £4, water placement, unique

## Common Patterns

### Income Supplement
- 2-3 Woodcutters alongside main strategy
- Passive gold supports expansion
- Low maintenance

### Forest Cluster
- Rare to find 3+ adjacent forests
- If available, strong income base
- £12-£18 per round (3-4 Woodcutters)

### Mixed Terrain Exploitation
- Forest/Grassland hexes
- Place Woodcutter if need income
- Place agricultural if need production

## Terrain Interactions

### Forest + Grassland
- £3-£4 cost
- Choose income (Woodcutter) vs production (agricultural)
- Common mixed terrain

### Forest + Mountain
- £4-£5 cost
- Choose Woodcutter (£4) vs Miner (£6)
- Usually prefer Miner for higher income

### Forest + River Delta
- Marina discount applies
- Strategic waterway position
- Good Woodcutter location

## Placement Priority

### High Priority
- Mixed Forest/Grassland (versatile)
- Low-cost forest (£2)
- Early game income need

### Medium Priority
- Pure forest (£3)
- Isolated forest hexes

### Low Priority
- High-cost forest (£4+)
- Distant forest (high shipping cost to reach)
- Late game (income less critical)

## Economy Calculation

**Single Woodcutter**:
- Cost: £5 (unit) + £3 (terrain) = £8 total
- Income: £4 per round
- Break-even: 2 rounds
- Rounds 3+: Pure profit

**Upgraded Woodcutter**:
- Upgrade cost: ~£4 (estimate)
- New income: £6 per round
- Upgrade pays for itself in 2 rounds

**Multiple Woodcutters**:
- 3 Woodcutters = £12 per round (base)
- 3 Upgraded = £18 per round
- Significant economic engine

## Comparison Table

| Worker Type | Base Income | Upgraded Income | Terrain | Availability |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| Woodcutter | £4 | £6 | Forest | All lords |
| Miner | £6 | £8 | Mountain | All lords |
| Fisherman | £4 | N/A? | Loch | Caspian only |

## Strategic Decisions

### When to Build Woodcutters
- **Early game**: Need passive income
- **Forest available**: Cheap or mixed terrain
- **Income gaps**: Between production cycles
- **Stable economy**: Long-term investment

### When to Skip
- **Limited forest**: Better opportunities elsewhere
- **High cost**: £5+ terrain not worth it
- **Late game**: Better to invest in production/contracts
- **Miners available**: Higher income potential

## Forest Scarcity

### Limited Forest Impact
- Fewer forests = higher competition
- Premium on Forest/Grassland mixed hexes
- Workers become luxury (focus production instead)

### Abundant Forest Impact
- Many forests = easy income
- Worker-heavy strategies viable
- Lower strategic value per forest
