# Grassland Terrain

## Overview

Grassland is the most versatile terrain type, supporting all agricultural production units and processing factories.

## Visual

- Color: Bright green
- Texture: Fields, pastures, meadows
- Common terrain type (40-50% of map)

## Placement Cost

**Pure Grassland**: £1-£2 (cheapest terrain)
**Mixed with other terrain**: £3-£6 (increases with terrain variety)

## Supported Units

### Production Units
- **Sheep** - Produces Wool
- **Cows** - Produces Milk
- **Fields** - Produces Grain

### Processing Buildings
- **Cheese Dairy** - Milk → Cheese
- **Bakery** - Grain → Bread
- **Distillery** - Grain → Whisky
- **Brewery** - Grain → Beer (Oswald only)

## Strategic Value

### Strengths
- Most versatile terrain
- Supports complete production chains
- Usually cheapest placement cost
- Most common terrain type

### Limitations
- High competition (everyone needs grassland)
- Low placement cost = low strategic defensibility
- Can become crowded quickly

## Placement Examples

**Example 1: Pure Grassland**
- Terrain cost: £2
- Place Sheep (£5): Total £7
- Place Cow (£6): Total £8
- Place Field (£4): Total £6

**Example 2: Mixed Grassland/Forest**
- Terrain cost: £4
- Can place: Any grassland unit OR Woodcutter
- Flexibility comes with higher cost

## Game States

### Hex Properties
- Terrain type: Grassland
- Placement cost: £1-£2 (pure) or £3-£6 (mixed)
- Occupant: One of 7 possible unit types

### Production Chains on Grassland

**Dairy Chain**:
1. Cow produces Milk
2. Cheese Dairy converts Milk → Cheese
3. Both require grassland hexes

**Grain Chain**:
1. Field produces Grain
2. Bakery converts Grain → Bread
3. OR Distillery converts Grain → Whisky
4. OR Brewery converts Grain → Beer (Oswald)
5. All require grassland hexes

**Wool Chain**:
1. Sheep produces Wool
2. Wool used directly (no processing)

## Strategic Considerations

### Distribution
- Grassland clusters enable production chains
- Isolated grassland less valuable
- Adjacent grassland hexes = efficient economy

### Competition
- All players need grassland
- Limited grassland = high competition
- Early claims important

### Specialization
- Dairy focus: Multiple Cows + Cheese Dairies
- Grain focus: Multiple Fields + Bakeries/Distilleries
- Wool focus: Multiple Sheep

### Mixed Strategies
- Diverse grassland production
- Flexible contract fulfillment
- Balanced economy

## Lord Synergies

### Strong on Grassland
- **Sir Bertram**: Cheap factories (all on grassland)
- **Dame Elspeth**: Cow/dairy specialist
- **Master Godwyn**: Distillery specialist
- **Brewmaster Oswald**: Brewery/grain specialist

### Moderate Benefit
- **Lord Aldric**: Needs diverse production (uses grassland)
- **Lady Isolde**: Benefits from any production
- **Lady Marina**: If deltas have grassland

### Low Direct Benefit
- **Baron Roderick**: Worker specialist (Forest/Mountain focus)
- **Lord Caspian**: Worker specialist
- But all still need some grassland for food production

## Common Patterns

### Compact Grassland Farm
- 4-6 adjacent grassland hexes
- Mix of Sheep/Cows/Fields
- 1-2 factories for processing
- Efficient, low shipping need

### Scattered Grassland
- Grassland hexes spread across map
- Requires shipping to connect
- Access to diverse terrain
- Higher expansion cost

### Grassland Monopoly
- Control large grassland cluster
- Block opponents from agriculture
- Dominant production
- High value target

## Terrain Interactions

### Grassland + Forest
- £3-£4 cost (mixed)
- Can place agricultural OR Woodcutter
- Balanced territories

### Grassland + Mountain
- £4-£5 cost (mixed)
- Can place agricultural OR Miner
- Premium locations

### Grassland + River
- Often river deltas (Marina bonus)
- Strategic positions
- Control waterways

## Placement Priority

### High Priority
- Large grassland clusters
- Mixed grassland (versatile)
- River delta grassland (Marina)
- Low-cost grassland (£1-£2)

### Medium Priority
- Isolated grassland hexes
- Higher cost grassland (£3+)
- Peripheral grassland

### Low Priority
- Single grassland surrounded by water/mountains
- Inaccessible grassland (far from owned territory)

## Economy Calculation

**Example Economy** (4 grassland hexes):
- 2 Cows = 2 Milk per round
- 1 Cheese Dairy = 1 Milk → 1 Cheese per round
- 1 Field = 1 Grain per round
- Output: 1 Milk, 1 Cheese, 1 Grain per Production Phase

**Value**:
- Products worth ~£15-£20 total
- Investment: ~£35-£45 (units + terrain)
- ROI over multiple rounds
